## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. One of my favorite apps is called Cooking Fever. It is a food simulation game where you have to serve different foods to customers at a restaurant. The user walks through owning a restaurant, preparing meals, and serving customers within a time constraint. It is a really enjoyable game because of the different levels and various restaurants the user can own.
-  Serving multiple customers at once
- Variety of meals that can be cooked (cool UI)
2. Tiktok
- scrolling and viewing a variety of videos
- being able to upload, delete, and view videos of other users.
- being able to follow/unfollow new users
3. Productivity App
- add new tasks/CRUD operations
- set calendar reminders
- set times for individual apps

I would like to build an app that mimics a digital journal. It would have different days on a calendar where you can take pictures and write small notes of how your day was. I think it'd be fun to create because it allows the user to create a mini photo album. It's different from iphone photos because it functions more so as a diary rather than a collection of random photos. One way I can think of implemneting this is perhaps for the MVP having a weekly overview photo diary, where the user can have a week worth of photos that they can take and write notes on. 

## Notes

I think one of the challenges I faced was learning where each of the labels/menu items were within the XCode platform. I've used XCode before but not for IOS development so I think getting used to the layout was a bit challenging. I also found that writing code was different from how we usually write it because of the side-by-side view.
